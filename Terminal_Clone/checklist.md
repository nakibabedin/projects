# Project (Shell) Overview

## Requirements
* Read a line at a time, parse the line to separate the command from its arguments. It should then fork and exec the command. The parent process should wait until the execâ€™d program exits and then it should read the next command.
Note: exit and cd cannot be run through a forked child process, you will have to implement these commands on your own. (These are not programs! Why you ask? think about it...)

* check out the chdir() function
* Read and separate multiple commands on one line with ;. That is, the line ls -l ; echo hello should first run the command ls -l and then echo hello.
* Implement simple redirection using > (redirecting stdout) and < (redirecting stdin).
This will be explained in class later.
* Implement simple pipes, that is: ls | wc would run ls and use the output from ls as the input for wc.
This will be explained in class.
Check out popen() for this.
* All of these commands work in bash, so use it to check out the functionality of each feature if you are unclear about anything.
Specific requirements
* Every function you write must have a function header comment describing the arguments, return value and what the function does.

## You should have a readme file with the following:
* A description of what features your shell implements
* A description of what features you attempted to implement but were unsuccessful
* Any bugs or things you want me to know about your program
* A copy of every function header

* The project should be built using make and a makefile, I will only compile by using make.

## Try starting with these restrictions on input:
To make your life easier, you could require that all items on the command line are to be separated by a single space.
When parsing the line, it might help to count the number of tokens (individual pieces), before parsing.
You can restrict the locations and ordering of > and <.
You can limit piping (|) to a single pipe.
If you would like to implement other features after getting these ones down, please do. Look at what bash does and see what else you can do!
